#row-eq-height
Makes bootstraps experimental row-eq-height work.

## Requirements
Jquery

## Usage
Just download the small script and include it somewhere behind Jquery. 

You can then use "row-eq-height" as a class besides "row" to make all columns in a row have the same height. 

Panels inside of those columns are also being resized equally.

## Demo
See [this jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/r7rwg78f/) as an example.
